## Command Line Basics

### Opening the Terminal

- Press `Ctrl+Alt+T` to open the terminal.

***

### Checking Your Directory

- Use `pwd` to display the current directory.

#### Notes:

- When the path is `~`, it means the CLI is in the home directory.

***

### Navigating Directories

- Use `cd` to change directories:\
    - `cd ~` takes you to your home directory.\
    - `cd ..` goes back one folder. Use `cd ../..` to go back multiple folders.
- Use `ls` to show the contents of a directory.\
    - Combine options with `--help` to get a list of commands.\
    - Example: `ls -la`\
      - `l` lists details of contents.\
      - `a` shows all files, including hidden ones (those with dots in front of them).\
      - Files starting with `.` are hidden by default in both the CLI and most GUIs.

***

### Permissions

- **d** = directory
- **r** = read
- **w** = write
- **x** = execute

***

### File & Directory Management

- `mkdir` - Create a new directory.
- `touch file.txt` - Create a file named **file.txt**.\
    - **Note:** If the file already exists, `touch` updates its timestamp.
- `cp file.txt directory_name` - Copy **file.txt** to the specified directory.
- `rm file.txt` - Remove **file.txt**.\
    - **Note:** To remove directories, use `rm -r directory_name`.
- `mv file.txt new_location` - Move **file.txt** to a new location.\
    - **Note:** You can rename the file while moving (e.g., `mv file.txt new_directory/new_name.txt`).
- `nano file.txt` - Open **file.txt** for editing.
- `cat file.txt` - Print the contents of **file.txt** in the CLI.
- `head file.txt -n #` - Show the first `#` lines of **file.txt**.
- `tail file.txt -n #` - Show the last `#` lines of **file.txt**.
